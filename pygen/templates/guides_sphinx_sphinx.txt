Introduction
************

Documentation:

- https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html

The Sphinx documentation is written using the
`reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#footnotes>`__ *.rst* language (though it
can also be written with the `Markdown <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>`__ *.md*
language).

Getting started
***************

Root of the project:

..  code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 3

    ../$project_name/
        $project_name-doc-source/...
        $project_name-docs/...
        $project_name/...
        .gitignore
        cli.py
        LICENSE
        make.bat
        Makefile
        README.md
        requirements.txt
        setup.py
        TODO.md

sphinx-autobuild
++++++++++++++++

Documentation:
- https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild

From the *root* folder, run the documentation on a local server which listens to any changes to the doc
and updates them live.

..  code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    $ sphinx-autobuild $project_name-doc-source/ $project_name-docs/

.. important::
    *$project_name-docs/* should be built with the previous commands, otherwise Github Pages won't be able to read the files
    properly. A *.nojekyll* file should also be added in the *$project_name-docs/* folder if it is not already present.

sphinx-build
++++++++++++

Documentation:
- https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html

From the *root* folder, run this command to simply build the documentation without listening to changes live.

..  code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    $ sphinx-build $project_name-doc-source/ $project_name-docs/

.. important::
    *$project_name-docs/* should be built with the previous commands, otherwise Github Pages won't be able to read the files
    properly. A *.nojekyll* file should also be added in the *$project_name-docs/* folder if it is not already present.
